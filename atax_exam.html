        <h2>Advanced Taxation Revision</h2>
        <h3>Question</h3>
        
            A is a publisher of educational books. It is planning to use Singapore as the ASEAN base for the distribution of books published in the UK.
            <br>
            <br>
            Under this plan, A will arrange to have books imported into Singapore for distribution to distributors in the various ASEAN countries. The contracts for the sale of books will be concluded 
            directly by A with the various ASEAN country distributors and these distributors will be invoiced 
            directly by A.
            <br>
            <br>
            The revenue from these ASEAN distributors will be booked as A’s revenue and it is estimated that 
            annual sales to the ASEAN region will be in the region of S$8m to S$10m. All the logistics will be 
            undertaken by an unrelated logistics company operating in Singapore. 
            <br>
            <br>
            For the coordination of its ASEAN distribution activity, A will incorporate a wholly owned 
            subsidiary in Singapore (SS). SS will be responsible for the liaison and co-ordination of the importation
            and delivery of books to the distributors in the various ASEAN countries and will receive a service fee 
            from A for this liaison and co-ordination service. The service fee will be computed on a “cost plus 
            5%” basis. Estimated annual running costs for SS is in the region of $1.5m.
            <br>
            <br>
            Advise A on all the income tax and GST implications of SS and this ASEAN distribution initiative and provide alternative suggestions where applicable. 
        
        <h2>Stuff from his slides</h2>
        
            oh god i'm so tired
            <br><br>
            GST is charged on the:
            <ul>
                <li>Supply of goods and services <strong>in Singapore</strong> by registered traders</li>
                <li><strong>Import</strong> of goods into Singapore</li>
            </ul>
            
            GST is collected by:
            <ul>
                <li>Registered traders</li>
                <li>Customs and Excise Department</li>
                <li>Overseas vendors!!! (for imports under OVR)</li>
            </ul>
            For the <a href="#low-value-items" style="color: #4a148c;">importation of low-value items</a>, <strong>GST is collected by overseas vendors</strong>. 
            This was a loophole that consumers exploited. One could simply order their goods from an overseas vendor and not pay tax. 
            <br>
            <br>
            cries... I can't believe those GST-less Taobao days are over!!
            <br>
            For the <a href="#services" style="color: #4a148c;">importation of services</a>, GST is collected by: <strong>note services!</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>"Reverse" charge</li>
                <li> Overseas vendors</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>This part of taxation I can never remember...</h4>
        Companies that have a turnover of more than $1mil must register for GST.
        The turnover includes:
        <ul>
            <li>Standard-rated supplies</li>
            <li>Zero-rated supplies</li>
        </ul>
        but excludes:
        <ul>
            <li>Exempt supplies</li>
            <li>Out-of-scope supplies</li>
        </ul>
        The determination of turnover can be based on retrospect. For example,
        the turnover in the last 12 months to 31 December. It can also be prospective,
        based on the expected turnover in the next 12 months.
        <br>
        <br>
        GST is a tax borne by consumers!!!! not traders,,, sigh,,,
        registered traders get credit for the GST paid on their purchases.
        <br> 
        If they collect more GST than they pay when they purchased their goods, they have to pay the difference back.
        If they pay more GST than they collect, the difference will be refunded to them.
        The business doesn't have to "match" the purchase of an item with the sale of that item to claim the input tax!!
        GST is collected at every stage of the supply chain.

        <h3 id = "supply"> Supply</h3>
        All forms of supply done for a consideration.
        <br>
        <br><strong>Non-taxable supplies</strong>:
        <br>
        <br>
        EXEMPT supplies:
        <ul>
            <li>Financial services
                <ul>
                    <li>Operation of current, deposit and savings account</li>
                    <li>Exchange of currencies</li>
                    <li>Provision of loan and credit</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Sale and lease of residential properties</li>                
            <li>Supply of investment precious metals</li>
        </ul>
        OUT-OF-SCOPE supplies:
        <ul>
            <li>Payment of salaries and wages</li>
            <li>Overseas sales</li>
            <li>Private transactions</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Taxable supplies</strong>:
        <br>
        <br>
        STANDARD-RATED supplies
        <ul>
            <li>Sale of food</li>
            <li>Sale of machine</li>
            <li>Provision of accounting services</li>
        </ul>
        ZERO-RATED supplies
        <ul>
            <li>Export of goods</li>
            <li>International services (Export of services)</li>
        </ul>
        Consider the time, place and value of supply!
        <br> 
        <br>
        Time: Earlier of invoice and payment date
        <br>
        <br>
        Place: <strong>Goods</strong> are in Singapore at time of supply = <strong>within scope supplies!</strong>
        <br>
        If the <strong>goods</strong> are supplied to a place in Singapore = <strong>standard-rated</strong>.
        <br>
        If the <strong>goods</strong> are supplied to a place outside Singapore (exported) = <strong id="zero-rated">zero-rated supply</strong>. This means that the GST is 0% but
        this is different from being out of scope because the business can still claim input tax.
        <br>
        <br>
        Place: <strong>Goods</strong> are outside Singapore at time of supply = <strong>out-of-scope supplies!</strong>. Note: <strong>goods!!</strong>
        <br>
        Place (<strong>Services</strong>): Supplier "belongs" in Singapore at the time of supply = <strong>within scope supplies!</strong>.
        <br>
        If the supplier "belongs" outside Singapore at the time of supply = <strong>out-of-scope supplies!</strong> but is <strong>subject to <a href="#reverse-charge" style="color:#4a148c;">reverse charge</a> & <a href="#ovr" style="color:#4a148c;">OVR</a></strong>.
        Note: <strong>services!!</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        "Belonging": Supplier belongs in Singapore if Singapore is the only place of business.
        If the supplier has multiple places of business, 
        the <strong>place of business</strong> that is <strong>most directly connected to the supply</strong> is the <strong>place of belonging</strong>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Value of supply: Amount on which GST is calculated. 
        <br>
        Open market value: Amount payable by a person who has no relationship with the supplier.
        <br>
        GST collected by the C&E Department at the point of importation is based on the value of import 
        <br>
        value of import = cost + insurance premium + (duty for dutiable goods) + freight charges. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="#supply" style="color: #4a148c;">Recall what supply is!</a> When there is no consideration,
        the supply may be DEEMED a supply and be subject to GST if they are:
        <ul>
            <li>Business gifts</li>
            <li>Business assets used for private purposes</li>
        </ul>
        If they have these characteristics, they are not deemed supplies:
        <ul>
            <li>Value < $200</li>
            <li>Commerical samples</li>
            <li>Provision of accommodation</li>
            <li>Catering of food to staff</li>
            <li>Trader not entitled to claim input tax</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trader is not GST-registered. So there is no GST on the purchase price. The amount paid for the gift is the same as the purchase price.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Input GST not claimed</li>
        </ul>
           
        Blocked input tax:
        <ul>
            <li>Motor car expenses</li>
            <li>Club subscription fee</li>
            <li>Goods for private use</li>
            <li>Entertainment expenses</li>
            <li>Medical and accident insurance expenses</li>
        </ul>
            
        <h3>Types of traders</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Exempt trader</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Trader who makes only exempt supplies</li>
                <li>Trader not GST registered</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Taxable trader</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Trader who makes standard-rated supplies</li>
                <li>Trader who makes <a href=#zero-rated style="color: #4a148c;"> zero-rated supplies</a></li>
                <li>Trader making both standard-rated and zero-rated supplies</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Partially exempt trader</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Trader who makes both taxable and exempt supplies</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        A partially exempt trader cannot claim credit for GST directly attributable to his exempt supplies. So he needs to apportion his residual input tax.
        <br> 
        <p>residual input tax &times; <sup>taxable supplies</sup>&frasl;<sub>total supplies</sub></p>
        
        <h4>De minimis rule</h4>
        Total exempt supplies do not exceed both:
        <ul>
            <li>5% of total supplies</li>
            <li>average of $40,000 per month</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="low-value-items">Importation of low-value items</h4>
        The values of these goods <$400. GST is chargeable via OVR.

        <h4 id="services">Importation of digital and non-digital services</h4>
        Digital services refer to:
        <ul>
            <li>Subscription to digital news, magazines, movies, music</li>
            <li>Download of software</li>
            <li>Support services like booking services</li>
            <li>Mobile apps, e-books, movies</li>  
        </ul>
        Non-digital services refer to:
        <ul>
            <li>Investment, advisory, brokerage services</li>
            <li>Professional services like legal, tax and accounting services</li>
            <li>Professional memberships, examinations and distance learning services</li>
            <li>Online counselling, matchmaking, telemedical services</li>
            <li>Consulting services like marketing, data analysis and research services</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B2B</h3>
        Recall that if the supplier "belongs" outside Singapore at the time of supply,
        the supply is out-of-scope but subject to <strong><a id="reverse-charge">reverse charge</a></strong>.
        
        <h4>What is reverse charge?</h4>
        Let's say A is a Singaporean company and B is a foreign company. B provides services from overseas to A that cost $100k.
        <br>
        A would <strong>"charge" itself</strong> GST of $9k (output GST, not input) <strong>as though it is making the supply to itself</strong>. 
        As this is a business purchase, A can claim the $9k as its input GST (remember input tax is from purchasing, output tax is from charging it to customers).
        <br>
        Reverse charge doesn't apply to fully taxable persons. <strong>It only applies to partially exempt and exempt traders</strong>.
        
        <h3>B2C</h3>
        Recall that if the supplier "belongs" outside Singapore at the time of supply,
        the supply is out-of-scope but subject to <strong><a id="ovr">OVR</a></strong>.

        <h4>What is Overseas Vendor Registration (OVR)</h4>
        Overseas vendors must register for GST if:
        <ul>
            <li>Global revenue >$1mil per annum</li>
            <li>Singapore revenue >$100k per annum</li>
        </ul>
        They charge GST if the Singaporean customer is not GST-registered. Otherwise, they won't.
