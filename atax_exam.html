        <h2>Advanced Taxation Revision</h2>
        <h3>Question</h3>
        
            A is a publisher of educational books. It is planning to use Singapore as the ASEAN base for the distribution of books published in the UK.
            <br>
            <br>
            Under this plan, A will arrange to have books imported into Singapore for distribution to distributors in the various ASEAN countries. The contracts for the sale of books will be concluded 
            directly by A with the various ASEAN country distributors and these distributors will be invoiced 
            directly by A.
            <br>
            <br>
            The revenue from these ASEAN distributors will be booked as A’s revenue and it is estimated that 
            annual sales to the ASEAN region will be in the region of S$8m to S$10m. All the logistics will be 
            undertaken by an unrelated logistics company operating in Singapore. 
            <br>
            <br>
            For the coordination of its ASEAN distribution activity, A will incorporate a wholly owned 
            subsidiary in Singapore (SS). SS will be responsible for the liaison and co-ordination of the importation
            and delivery of books to the distributors in the various ASEAN countries and will receive a service fee 
            from OUP for this liaison and co-ordination service. The service fee will be computed on a “cost plus 
            5%” basis. Estimated annual running costs for SS is in the region of $1.5m.
            <br>
            <br>
            Advise A on all the income tax and GST implications of SS and this ASEAN distribution initiative and provide alternative suggestions where applicable. 
        
        <h3>Stuff from his slides</h3>
        
            oh god i'm so tired
            <br><br>
            GST is charged on the:
            <ul>
                <li>Supply of goods and services in Singapore by registered traders</li>
                <li>Import of goods into Singapore</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            GST is collected by:
            <ul>
                <li>Registered traders</li>
                <li>Customs and Excise Department</li>
                <li>Overseas vendors!!! (for imports under OVR)</li>
            </ul>
            For the importation of low-value items, GST is collected by overseas vendors. 
            This was a loophole that consumers exploited. One could simply order their goods from an overseas vendor and not pay tax. 
            <br>
            <br>
            cries... I can't believe those GST-less Taobao days are over!!
            For the importation of services, GST is collected by: <strong>note services!</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>"Reverse" charge</li>
                <li> Overseas vendors</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>This part of taxation I can never remember...</h4>
        
            Companies that have a turnover of more than $1mil must register for GST.
            The turnover includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Standard-rated supplies</li>
                <li>Zero-rated supplies</li>
            </ul>
            but excludes:
            <ul>
                <li>Exempt supplies</li>
                <li>Out-of-scope supplies</li>
            </ul>
            The determination of turnover can be based on retrospect. For example,
            the turnover in the last 12 months to 31 December. It can also be prospective,
            based on the expected turnover in the next 12 months.
            <br>
            <br>
            GST is a tax borne by consumers!!!! not traders,,, sigh,,,
            registered traders get credit for the GST paid on their purchases.
            <br> 
            If they collect more GST than they pay when they purchased their goods, they have to pay the difference back.
            If they pay more GST than they collect, the difference will be refunded to them.
            The business doesn't have to "match" the purchase of an item with the sale of that item to claim the input tax!!
            GST is collected at every stage of the supply chain.

        <h4>SUPPLY!!!</h4>
        
            All forms of supply done for a consideration.
            <br>
            <br><strong>Non-taxable supplies</strong>:
            <br>
            <br>
            EXEMPT supplies:
            <ul>
                <li>Financial services
                    <ul>
                        <li>Operation of current, deposit and savings account</li>
                        <li>Exchange of currencies</li>
                        <li>Provision of loan and credit</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Sale and lease of residential properties</li>
                <li>Supply of investment precious metals</li>
            </ul>
            OUT-OF-SCOPE supplies:
            <ul>
                <li>Payment of salaries and wages</li>
                <li>Overseas sales</li>
                <li>Private transactions</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Taxable supplies</strong>:
            <br>
            <br>
            STANDARD-RATED supplies
            <ul>
                <li>Sale of food</li>
                <li>Sale of machine</li>
                <li>Provision of accounting services</li>
            </ul>
            ZERO-RATED supplies
            <ul>
                <li>Export of goods</li>
                <li>International services (Export of services)</li>
            </ul>
            Consider the time, place and value of supply!
            <br> 
            <br>
            Time: Earlier of invoice and payment date
            <br>
            <br>Place: Goods are in Singapore at time of supply = <strong>within scope supplies!</strong>
            <br>If the goods are supplied to a place in Singapore, it will be standard-rated.
            <br>If the goods are supplied to a place outside Singapore (exported), it is a zero-rated supply. This means that the GST is 0% but
            this is different from being out of scope because the business can still claim input tax.
            <br>
            <br>Place: Goods are outside Singapore at time of supply = <strong>out-of-scope supplies!</strong>
