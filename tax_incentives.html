            <li><a href="#gtp" style="color:#4a148c;">Global Trader Programme</a></li>
        </ul>
        Finally, there is the <a href="ric" style="color:#4a148c;">Refundable Investment Credit</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Before going through these, remember that the claim of CA is mandatory except for:
        <ul>
            <li>Investment >$150mil</li>
            <li>Investment that will enhance the economic or technological development of SG</li>
            <li>>50% of paid-up capital held by citizens or PR</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="pioneer">Pioneer Incentive</h3>
        <p>
            It grants <strong>tax exemption for up to 15 years</strong>. The incentive is granted to companies that pioneer a new industry or product.
            Can non-pioneer business be carried on the pioneer business?
            <br>
            <br>
            Separate books must be kept for the pioneer and non-pioneer businesses. <strong>Non-pioneer loss must be setoff against pionoeer profits</strong>.
            <br>
            <br>
            If the <strong>adjusted profits of the non-pioneer service <5% </strong>, the non-pioneer business will be <strong>deemed</strong> to have adjusted profits of 5%. The pioneer profits will be reduced acordingly.
            <br>
            <br>
            If the non-pioneer business is incidental and negligible, the non-pioneer business may be amalgamated as pioneer activity.
            <br>Negligible = <5% of the turnover
            <br>There are post-pioneer incentives to gradually phase the pioneer and export companies to fully tax paying companies.
        </p>
        <h3 id="dei">Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI)</h3>
        <p>
            This incentive grants companies with a <strong>concessionary tax rate of not less than 5%</strong>.
            <br>
            It is applicable to "expansion income" and has a period of <strong>up to 20 years</strong>.
            <br>
            <br>
            To compute the expansion income, deduct CA from adjusted profits to get the qualifying income, then deduct the "base" profit to get the "expansion income". The "base" profit is the average annual profit of the last 3 years before the incentive period.
            <strong>Don't forget to tax the "base" profit</strong>. Normal procedure: Partial tax exemption, then a 17% on the remaining profits! 
        </p>
        <h3 id="ia">Investment Allowance (IA)</h3>
        <p>
            IA is based on the percentage of "Qualifying Investment".

                <li>Productive equipment</li>
            </ul>
            The "Investment Period" is the period within which "qualifying investments" will qualify for IA.
            The maximum period is 5 years or 8 years if under hire purchase.
            <br>
            <strong>IA is setoff against CI</strong> to get Net CI. Excess IA can be carried forward indefinitely. However, there are some restrictions:
            <ul>
                <li>The qualifying plant <strong>cannot be disposed within 2 years of the end of the "investment period" unless approval is granted</strong>.</li>
